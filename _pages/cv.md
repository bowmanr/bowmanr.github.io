### Abstract
I have a long-standing interest in investigating cellular behaviors and interactions in complex environments. My PhD studies in the Joyce Lab focused on uncovering the transcriptional regulation and developmental ontogeny of tumor-associated macrophages in brain tumors. I employed computational tools and a number of different genetic lineage tracing and tumor models with complementary analysis on patient-derived specimen. As I studied the functions of myeloid cells in disease, I became increasingly interested in the epigenetic mechanisms regulating their development, and how these processes can be co-opted in leukemia. 

In the fall of 2016, I began my postdoctoral work with Dr. Ross Levine, setting out to model clonal evolution and clone-clone interactions in myeloid leukemias. In a recently published co-first author study in Nature, I developed an analytical framework for the analysis of single cell DNA sequencing, resulting in a comprehensive understanding of the genetic architecture of myeloid malignancy.  I further developed a series of novel murine genetic tools to evaluate mutation order and oncogene-dependency using multiple, orthogonally inducible recombinases. These studies have revealed distinct patterns disease penetrance and immunophenotype depending upon the cooperating mutations.

### Patents
1.	Compositions and methods for treatment of glioma (PCT/US2016/031431). Daniela F Quail, Johanna A Joyce, Robert L Bowman.  This patent covers the dual targeting of CSF-1R inhibition and PI3-Kinase inhibition, or IGF-1R inhibitors, in the treatment of glioblastoma multiforme and other brain malignancies.  The rationale is that CSF-1R targeting results in altered tumor associated macrophage function which engenders a dependency in tumor cells upon macrophage-derived IGF1 for survival. November 17th, 2016
2.	Inhibition of colony stimulating factor-1 receptor signaling for the treatment of brain cancer (PCT/US2013/036628). Johanna A Joyce, Robert L Bowman.  This patent covers the utility of a gene expression signature in predicting responsiveness to CSF-1R inhibitor therapy in glioblastoma multiforme and other brain malignancies. October 24th, 2013
