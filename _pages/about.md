### Overview
I am currently a postdoctoral fellow with Dr. Ross Levine at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. I study how acquired mutations can cause normal blood and immune cell production to go awry. As people age, many will acquire mutations in their blood, a state termed clonal hematopoiesis. Despite relatively normal blood production, clonal hematopoiesis has been associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease and development of leukemia. Estimates of the prevalence of clonal hematopoiesis vary by detection method and age group, with some estimates of 25-50% of individuals over the age of 80 being affected. Despite this widespread phenomenon only a fraction of these patients will go on to form leukemia. I am particularly interested in this latter "transformation" event where I study the following broad questions:
1) What are the necessary steps for a mutant cell to transform to leukemia?
2) After transformation, how do these leukemic cells affect normal non-mutated cells?
3) How can we revert or halt transformed cells early in disease development to prevent disease development?

### Approach
To address these questions, I use combination of laboratory techniques including mouse modeling of disease, cell culture experiments, and computational methods
